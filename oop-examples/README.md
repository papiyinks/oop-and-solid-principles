Four Pillars of OOP

1. Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is protection mechanism for your class and data structure. It makes your life much easier. With Encapsulation you have a control to access and set class parameters and methods.

    Public.. no protection
    private.. if the class is extended to another class, the method cannot be used bt for protected, it can be used in a sub class

2. Inheritance
    To inherit behaviour, attributes from a parent class.The word extend is used on the child to get the methods from the parent

3. Polymophism
    Polymorphism describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface.

    Interface - a binding contract        

4. Abstract class. (abstraction)
    To show the needed/relevant information or details without showing all information which is not necessary is called abstraction.
    Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details of the object to the user. Abstraction “shows” only the essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort. It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.
